== RubyPants

RubyPants is a Ruby port of the smart-quotes library SmartyPants.

The original "SmartyPants" is a free web publishing plug-in for
Movable Type, Blosxom, and BBEdit that easily translates plain ASCII
punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML
entities.

See rubypants.rb for more information.


== Incompatibilities

RubyPants uses a different API than SmartyPants; it is compatible to
Red- and BlueCloth.  Usually, you call RubyPants like this:

  nicehtml = RubyPants.new(uglyhtml, options).to_html

where +options+ is an Array of Integers and/or Symbols (if you don't
pass any options, RubyPants will use <tt>[2]</tt> as default.)

*Note*:: This is incompatible to SmartyPants, which uses <tt>[1]</tt>
         for default.

The exact meaning of numbers and symbols is documented at RubyPants#new.
