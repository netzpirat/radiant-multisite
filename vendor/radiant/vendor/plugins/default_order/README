DefaultOrder
============

The default_order plugin provides a 'order_by' method to
be called in your models.

ex : 

class Contact < ActiveRecord::Base
  order_by "first_name, last_name"

end

the order_by method will append the given argument to 
:order Hash key of ActiveRecord::Base.find method
IF IT HAS NOT BEEN PROVIDED.

ex : 

Contact.find(:all, :conditions => "last_name LIKE '%toto%'")
# will act as if you had written this
Contact.find(:all, :order => "last_name, first_name",
	:conditions => "last_name LIKE '%toto%'")
# but if you provide :order it will override the default order

If you use those attributes in other models, you
may want to specify the table_name :
 
class Contact < ActiveRecord::Base
  order_by "contacts.first_name, contacts.last_name"

end
