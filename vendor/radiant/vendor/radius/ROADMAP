= Roadmap

This is a prioritized roadmap for future releases:

1. Clean up the current code base. [Done]

2. Add support for multi-level contexts: tags should be able to be
   defined to only be valid within other sets of tags. [Done]

3. Create a simple DSL for defining contexts. [Done]

4. Optimize for speed. Incorporate strscan?
